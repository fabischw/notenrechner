# CONTRIBUTING

# NOTE: AT THIS POINT IN TIME, CONTRIBUTING IS NOT POSSIBLE YET

### basic guidelines
- useful changes only
- useful changes only (only changes that are actually useful)
- readable code only (please provide commands and well structured software if you want to contribute)
- safe code only (try minimizing the implementation of new dependencies if possible)
- provide documentation for feature or add the feature to [missing documentations](./documentation/missing_documentation.md)
