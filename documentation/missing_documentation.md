# missing documentation
- list of features / components that aren't documentated yet


### adding to list
- please add to the list that fits the topic of the feature the best
- please only add a feature to the list if you can't write a documentation yourself
- split bigger changes up into multiple functions
- for code: provide a small summary of the features at the bottom of your code changes so people don't have to go trough your code line by line
